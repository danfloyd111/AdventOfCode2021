# AdventOfCode2021
My solutions to "Advent of code 2021" problems.

I started this year's challenge to improve my knowledge of Haskell and Go. For the moment I was just able to write Hs solutions because I'm busy with my job and you know... life in general :D

But as soon as I find some time I'm planning to refactor all the solutions in Haskell and solve the problems also using Go, to learn it better.

Happy coding,
Cheers!
